  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p>
    Swarsanskar Music Academy was founded by 
    <strong>Shri Ranjit Gaonkar</strong>, a simple and humble man from the village of 
    <strong>Ovliye</strong> in Sindhudurg.
  </p>

  <p>
    His uncle, <strong>Namdevbuva Ghadigaonkar</strong>, was a well-known 
    <strong>Adhyatmik Bhajan</strong> artist of his time, while his father was an 
    <strong>Adhyatmik scholar</strong>. Coming from such a rich spiritual and musical background, 
    music naturally became an important part of his life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ranjit Gaonkar began his music journey under 
    <strong>Pt. Wamanrao Karane Guruji</strong> at Katta. 
    Later, due to personal reasons, he shifted to Mumbai.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Mumbai, he met the renowned Pakhawaj maestro 
    <strong>Pt. Madhukar Mahadik</strong>, from whom he learned the 
    <strong>Kudensingh Gharana Pakhawaj Solo</strong> style for about <strong>4–5 years</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    After that, he continued his Pakhawaj training with 
    <strong>Pt. Prakash Sejwal</strong> for another <strong>5–6 years</strong>, polishing his skills further.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later, he came under the guidance of 
    <strong>Shri Rajarambuva Sutar</strong> for Vocal music, under whom he completed his 
    <strong>Sangeet Visharad</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Swarsanskar Music Academy first began in <strong>Kandivali</strong> around <strong>2007–08</strong>.  
    From <strong>2014 to the present</strong>, the academy has been running successfully in 
    <strong>Vasai</strong> at his residence, guiding students in classical music, Pakhawaj, and Bhajan traditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Apart from being a dedicated musician and teacher, 
    <strong>Shri Ranjit Gaonkar is also a Lawyer</strong> by profession.
